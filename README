Trying to get GNUstep to work on Linux...
First install GNUStep: https://github.com/plaurent/gnustep-build

Then run one of these two commands:
    make -f GNUmakefile # (build with GNUstep shite)
    aite # (build w/o GNUstep shite, needs https://github.com/rweichler/aite)

for the 1st one, you also might need to source this thing:
    . /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
