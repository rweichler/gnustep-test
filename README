Trying to get GNUstep to work on Linux...

First install GNUStep: https://github.com/plaurent/gnustep-build

Then run one of these two commands:
    make -f Makefile # (build without GNUstep shite)
    make -f GNUmakefile # (build with GNUstep shite)

the 2nd one goes by default. you also might need to source a thing:
    /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
